New tees received. These were made to be an athletic fit and I'm super impressed with the quality of these pieces. The only issue I have with this current batch is that the neck is a little wider than I wanted. This passes the personal test, but I am already seeing where I can improve on V2. The plan is to have constant iterations of this core tee until it gets to the exact silhouette I'd like, then any future changes will be named a different piece.<br>
