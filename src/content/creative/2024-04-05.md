All the product touched down. I'm so hype to prep this launch. QC will begin this weekend and I'll inspect every item. One issue I already have is that the lighters are rusted inside the case. An easy fix (vineager, warm water, and a wire brush), but annoying nonetheless. Not a huge deal since they aren't the main product.
