Personal: A lot of things going on at the moment (all good things!). We are prepping for the arrival of our son, Arlo and couldn't be more excited. Prepping means moving things around and making sure everything is in place. It's been an experience, but I'm happy with the overall results (even though I got kicked out my office and moved into the basement lol).

Work: Work is smooth sailing at the moment. Nothing to note, but there should be a big change for me in a few months (around July) which is exciting :).

Business: Barrage800 is still pending launch due to the manufacturing of the product. There is a lot in the pipeline and I'm super excited to see where this brand will go. Sample Surplus is...at a stand-still and I'm still trying to figure out what to do with the brand for the future. I would love to continue, but I am planning on getting rid of my direct-to-garment machine very soon to clear space in the garage. This will make it a little more difficult to produce ahd push shirts at a frequency I once did. Definitely something I need to decide on soon. I should probably give myself a deadline.

*This was a super long note. I'll try to dial them back to a bullet format.
