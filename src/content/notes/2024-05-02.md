Started a fun little project and bought an [AdaFruit MacroPad](https://www.adafruit.com/product/5128).

It was a nice and fun little introduction for me to tinker with an electronic and customize it with a little coding. I created a couple of sample macros, but overall, I'm using the macros provided by AdaFruit [here](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Learning_System_Guides/tree/main/Macropad_Hotkeys/macros); notably the Photoshop, Illustrator, and Safari ones

If I continue to do more projects, I will likely create my own projects page and will move this to that page. Until then, it'll live here in my captain's log.
