Long time no post! It's been a hell of a 2025 and I'm finally getting around to updating this.

- The kids are growing up <i>too fast</i>
- I've been running a lot and trying to get back into shape.
- I'm back in the gym
- Started a routine of getting up betwee 5-530am on weekdays to work out or meditate/sharpen my mind
- Realized how much I love/miss snowboarding
- Landed on a great team at work and I'm loving the work I'm doing
- Doing my best to cook/prep food at home
- Bought a Ninja Creami (let's gooooo!)
- Added the Rivian R1S to my "must have" list (hopefully in a year or so)

That's all I can think of for now. I'm going to make it a goal to post here at least 1x a week.

Also I think I'm going to try and redo the website whenever I get a chance. Change it up a bit.

Oh yea- I also archived my 2024 posts. You can find them <a href="/captains-log-archive/2024">here</a> or at the top of the captains log page.
