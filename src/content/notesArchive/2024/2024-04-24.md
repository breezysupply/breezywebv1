Been a minute since I've really posted. The past week in summary:
- I went back to work this week after 3 weeks of paternity leave; honestly not as bad as I expected
- I'm annoyingly sick and I can't wait to get over it
- Arlo is mf 9 lbs already
- Ellie snapped out of her mini-monster phase (whew)
- Shot a fun promo video for Barrage800 with Jack
- Watched Draft 1 of a craaazy video Six and Raul put together for Barrage (can NOT wait for the final cut)
- Finished watching Fallout on Prime. Excellent series and it makes me wanna play the game
- Going to finally get started on a little Raspberry Pi project I've had on the back burner pretty soon
- Waiting to stop being annoyingly sick so I can get into a workout routine again

Fin.
