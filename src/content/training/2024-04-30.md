<b>Chest & Back:</b><br>
Honestly- I did <i>not</i> track the weights on this so I'll just list the exercises:
<b>Chest Press:</b> 3x12
<b>Lat Pull-Down:</b> 3x12
<b>DB Bench Press:</b> 3x12
<b>Seated Row:</b> 3x12
</b>DB Row:</b> 3x12 each arm

<b>Notes:</b> Since 4/29 was my first day back in a while, I was pretty sore working out today, but overall it felt great.
