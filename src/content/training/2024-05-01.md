<b>Runs:</b><br>
I started run training this month to prepare for the Ragnar Trail Richmond. My pace hasn't been great, but I'm getting there.

3/3: 3.15 miles @ 9:00/mile pace
3/14: 3 miles @ 8:58/mile pace
3/17: 3 miles @ 8:37/mile pace
3/18: 2.5 miles @ 8:21/mile pace
3/20: 2 miles @ 8:01/mile pace

<b>Notes:</b> Still have a long way to go, but I'm pretty happy with how I'm getting back to my old pace.
